# diet_app
Online diet store for training plans and diets with an additional calorie and diet calculator
This application was written in the XAMPP environment using: HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP.
Positioning of page elements was created thanks to BOOTSTRAP, and table pagination was created using JQUERY.
All the PHP functions used in the project were written in a separate file using PHP Data Objects (PDO).
The database connection was also written in a separate file.
